# Dependency Injection

## 3 approaches
* Singleton: object stays for the lifetime of app
* Scoped: lifetime of object is lifetime of each request
* Transient: object is created when it's requested

## How it effects objects created
- DI approaches decide when object is created, how long is it's lifetime, when it is destroyed
